Major hurdles:

A major goal of mine was to have the background change. I was going to assign it to a button but was not able to change the background image property since I implemented it with CSS but found a solution on google using JQuery-Backstretch. 

Another hurdle was using flexbox, I had to research how to implement flexbox accurately. 

I also had trouble thinking of ways to implement Javascript but ended up manipulating the DOM to create links to email me as well as view my resume on a separate page.
